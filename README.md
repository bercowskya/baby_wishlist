# Baby Wish List

This project contains a Node.js proxy server for Grist and a simple HTML page to display a baby gift list.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone or download** the repository and navigate to the folder in your terminal.

2. **Run the Node server**:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   
This starts the proxy on port 3000 (or whichever port you have configured).

3. Open another terminal (in the same folder) and start a local server for the HTML page:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8080
   
(If you prefer another web server or version of Python, adapt accordingly.)

Open the webpage in your browser by visiting: [Link](http://localhost:8080/index.html)
